# superpowers-html5.com

This is the source  project for [Superpowers's official website](http://superpowers-html5.com/).  
It is a static website built using Superpowers itself and hosted
[on GitHub Pages](https://github.com/superpowers/superpowers-html5.com/tree/gh-pages).

## How to contribute

The [Superpowers Web](http://github.com/superpowers/superpowers-web) system uses [Pug](http://pugjs.com/) for HTML and [Stylus](http://stylus-lang.com/) for stylesheets.

For now, you'll need to build it from source. See [Building Superpowers](http://docs.sparklinlabs.com/en/development/building-superpowers).

Once Superpowers v1.0 is released, installing a new system will be possible in a couple of clicks!
